During the pandemic, with the restrictions caused by the covid and the beginning of the work-from-home era, most of us spent the majority of our time inside our own homes. 
Life goes on, and time continues to pass so we had to adapt, but we can hardly stand the cities suffocated by concrete, dusty streets, and hellish traffic. So, we began to appreciate the time spent outdoors, in natural settings, surrounded by greenery and tranquility. 
  
Therefore, the "isolated chalet" accommodations have been very successful in the last years and still enjoy success even if the price of renting such chalets is quite high in Romania at least. 
  
While we were working between the same four walls, we looked longingly at Instagram photos of those who spent their weekends at a cottage on top of a mountain, only them surrounded by nature, without finding any availability any time soon for us to go there as well. Given the high demand, more and more such accommodations have started to appear. Which is great! Especially since most of them are made with respect for the environment, by reusing materials and having a design that matches the natural environment. And you will see that in the description of these locations the same inviting words "nature", "quiet", "secluded", and "no neighbors" are used. So, you can totally and easily "disconnect".

Although my favorite platform is booking.com, I found several such accommodations on airbnb.com, and I made a list of 10 such special accommodations in Romania. So here is my selection: 
  
<span>1.</span> [TripSylvania Tiny House](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/44628810?federated_search_id=f8f20d3e-9bc3-499a-a724-8d3058dda38d&source_impression_id=p3_1652088740_KCtVf9tb42vgw%2BVB){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}

## What did we choose? 
##### NorAtlas Heritage, Varlaam, Gura Teghii, Buzau 

{% responsive_image path: assets/images/posts/isolated-chalet/IMG_20220508_110645_modif_dbkkkg.webp alt: "Isolated Chalet"%}

We spent a relaxing weekend at NorAtlas Heritage, where we disconnected. We arrived quite late on Friday night after 3 hours of driving from Bucharest. The roads to get there are OK, but there are also parts with potholes. The main problem was that we went through many villages, and on serpentines and because I have motion sickness it wasn't a very pleasant trip for me. But when I arrived at the destination and breathed the fresh air, I felt it was worth it. The tiny house is located in the Varlaam village, Gura Teghii commune, Buzau County, near the Penteleu massif, on the river Basca. 
  
As they said in the description, "NorAtlas is located in the middle of nature, without neighbors and with a fairytale view." But this thing is about to change as they are building another house in front of NorAtlas. You will still have some privacy, but we would have liked to know this detail before booking with them. Overcoming this inconvenience, the view is still wonderful. Everywhere you look, you see only greenery which is so refreshing and invigorating. We were very pleased with the idea of living alone in a house positioned in such a natural setting, far from civilization, but still with a minimum of comfort: hot water, shower, the necessary tools to be able to prepare something to eat, air conditioning, Wi-Fi.

We appreciated that there were nets on all windows, that there was a hairdryer in the bathroom, that the kitchen was equipped with what was needed to prepare and serve the meal, that they left a small disinfectant and cleaning products, and that they left two bottles of water and two colas in the fridge, that they left some leaflets about what to visit in the area, that we found cleanliness, that we had a barbecue in the yard and a place to dine outdoors. 
  
The hosts were very welcoming, but like everywhere some aspects can be improved. For example, slippers would have been more appropriate not to be "of the house" or to be made of a material that can be disinfected. We didn't give in to the plastic greenery in the bathroom or to the Christmas arrangements present in May. I would have liked to find a basket of a few apples instead of the carbonated drinks. I would also have liked to have wood and charcoal for the grill, not to come with them from home. But we believe that all these aspects can be easily corrected.

We set out to leave the car for the weekend and to walk around the accommodation on foot. We went to Piatra lui Visan, which we filmed and photographed from all angles, and then we climbed the hill behind the tiny house where a sheepfold is, but we quickly returned because we were afraid of the dogs.

I would like to end with the strongest point of NorAtlas Heritage (this is only our honest opinion of course): the surrounding nature, the silence during the night, the crickets, the chirping of the birds, and the fresh mountain air. These were the reasons we came in the first place, and we feel that we have reached our goal. 
  
Here's to discovering new destinations and unique accommodations!
