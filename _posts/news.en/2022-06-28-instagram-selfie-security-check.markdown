According to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61828900){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}, Instagram tests new ways through which it can check a user's real age. One of the ways can be video selfies which will be analyzed using face recognition software. 

US teens will be able to verify age in three ways: upload ID, ask three adult users to approve their age, or take a video selfie which will be analyzed.
