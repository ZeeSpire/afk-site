I made a list of places where you can eat good food in Constanta, in my humble opinion of course. We ate in all these places multiple times and they were good enough to make this list. So let's get started.

### Miss Baker
There was a saying "Life is short. Eat dessert first.". Because sweets are a big part of my diet, I will start with a cake shop recommendation. Miss Baker has some of the most delicious cakes in Constanta. They also have a nice terrace outside where you can enjoy a coffee and a cannoli if the weather permits. Every single time we're in Constanta we stuff our fridge with lots of cakes from Miss Baker. They are simply delicious. We particularly like Marlenka, the cannoli, the cannoli cheesecake. You have to try them, you'll thank me later. They also deliver some of their products. You can order from [here](https://shop.missbaker.ro/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

### Popina
Popina represents local cuisine, respect for ingredients, seasonal menu, cozy atmosphere and very good service. This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Constanta. 
I really love the interior design of the villa that houses the restaurant, the service is always top notch, and the food is delicious. I liked most of the dishes and beverages that I tried here, especially the gratin mushroom cream bruschettas, the suberek, the rustic mashed potatoes, and the amber cola. They always try to refresh their menu which is to be appreciated. This is their instagram [account](https://www.instagram.com/popinadobrogea/?hl=en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

### Pescaria lui Matei
This one isn't in Constanta, and it's accessible only if you have a car. But I like this place so much that I couldn't not include it in my list. It's a place open all year round, the food is delicious, and the place is so charming with views over the Black Sea. Come here only if you're in the mood for fish or sea fruit like mussels. Here you will find a delicious sandwich with fish, even a fish burger, soups with fish, fish "zacusca", and many more specialities. If you can't reach their location in Agigea, they have a takeaway spot in Constanta as well, and they deliver. You can find the menu [here](https://www.pescarialuimatei.ro/meniu){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

### Marinara
The pizza for Marinara is very good, maybe the best in Constanta I would dare to say. My favorite one si Diavola. Simple and delicious. This is their [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/marinarapizzabar/?hl=en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} if you would like to see how their perfect pizza looks like.

### Rumen
This place is a good option for brunch as well as for a consistent lunch. They serve benefict eggs, mushrooms on a toast with avocado, scrambled eggs, pancakes, but also pizza, pasta and panini's. My favorite from them are the Benedict eggs, funghi gustosi, the hummus, and the paninis. Here is their [website](https://rumen.meniuonline.ro/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

### Pui cu bacon
If you're in the mood for some quick fix, this is the place to come. Don't spend your money on anything else then the "pui cu bacon" sandwich. The place is called like that for a reason, there was a time this was the best sandwich in town. It is delicious, but as a recommendation request for less mayonaise in the sandwich. Their website is: [http://puicubacon.ro/](http://puicubacon.ro/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

We will update this list as we try other restaurants and places to go out in Constanta.
