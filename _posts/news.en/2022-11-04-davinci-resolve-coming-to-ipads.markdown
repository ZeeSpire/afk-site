Blackmagic Design recently announced that they will launch Davinci Resolve on iPads. 

The video editing software we use will come to Apple iPads with M processors later this year (2022). It has the best color grading features in the world and competes with software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple's Final Cut Pro.

From the screenshots they published it seems that it will come with the same features as it has on the PC or Mac but at the launch date it will actually have less features. 

What did Apple do? Will Blackmagic Design be the company that will boost iPad sales?

The most important thing is that Davinci Resolve will be optimized for MultiTouch technology and Apple Pencil. DaVinci Resolve for iPad features support for cut and color pages providing access to DaVinci's award-winning image technology, color finishing tools, and the latest HDR workflows. It will also be optimized for performance for Apple Silicon, and will deliver 4x faster Ultra HD ProRes render performance on the new iPad Pro with M2.

Davinci Resolve for iPad will allow collaboration and favor mobility and it will have a free version as well as a paid studio version.

For more information you can check the [press release](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/media/release/20221020-02){:target="_blank"}.

iPads with M1 and M2 processors are more powerful than most of the Intel and AMD laptops on the market, but they lack productivity apps and a full OS as iPadOS is still limited even if Apple launched support for external HDDs, Stage Manager application for multi-tasking, and other features through which it tries to bring the iPads closer to the MacBook. Needles to say they are not there yet.

Will Apple make iPadOS more like a Mac? Or will Apple launch a touchscreen MacBook in the future?

Time will tell. Until then we can enjoy Adobe Photoshop Lightroom for photo editing and Davinci Resolve for video editing.
