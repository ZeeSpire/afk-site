This year, Orthodox Easter falls on the 16th of April, and the offers dedicated to this holiday have already started to appear.
Most of the offers include 3 or 4 nights of accommodation, with the possibility of extending the stay, breakfast, special dinners, and traditional Easter dishes, but also other options to attract guests, such as trips, campfires, or egg-hunting for the children. Prices start from around 3000 RON (600 EUR) for two adults. To make it easier to convert from RON to EUR, I considered that 1 EUR = 5 RON.

Below you can find the offers that I found attractive.
