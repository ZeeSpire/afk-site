Santorini looks like it's straight off a postcard, but this island is much more than a pretty picture. It's about amazing sunsets, jaw-dropping views, luxurious hotels, friendly people, romance floating in the air, and delicious food. 

Santorini is a small, circular group of islands in the southern Aegean Sea, it forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades. 

Initially, Santorini was one round volcanic island (one of its previous names was Strongýlē which means "the circular one"). The name Santorini comes from Saint Irene, but the official name of the island is actually Thira. 

The island's volcano erupted many times with varying degrees of explosivity. Some eruptions formed the caldera (a term that comes from Latin caldaria, meaning "cooking pot"). One of the biggest eruptions in history, known as the Minoan eruption, took place in 1600 B.C. and supposedly led to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete.  

Santorini now includes the inhabited islands of Thira and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palea Kameni, and Aspronisi. 

The capital is the town of Fira which is conveniently located in the center of the island, and five kilometers from the airport. 

The best months to visit Santorini are June and September, but we went there in the middle of July, and we had a great time despite the strong winds, the scorching sun, and the hordes of tourists. 

Although it's a super small island, I feel that it has a lot to offer, it has something for everyone. So, it's up to you to choose what you prefer best. 

We stayed in Santorini 7 nights/8 days, and we switched 3 different hotels. We stayed in Oia, Akrotiri, and Imerovigli, and explored almost the entire island from these points. We preferred to rent a car to travel along and across the island. All three of our hotels offered private parking. It was a bit difficult to find parking spaces in the popular places, but we managed. 

I've put together a list of things that can be done in Santorini. 

1.) Wander on the streets of Oia.  

In Oia everywhere you look there's another picture-perfect view, it's like a painting. Although many paths are private, you can at least explore as much of this beautiful borough full of souvenir shops. 

2.) Watch the sunset 

It doesn't matter where you watch the sunset, it will paint some fantastic memories that you can carry in your heart. But I've put together a list of places where you can watch your Santorinian sunset from: ... 

3.) Visit Akrotiri Archeological Site 

4.) Enjoy Santorini's remarkable beaches 
Because of the volcanic eruptions, you'll find here some of the most interesting and apart beaches, like Vlychada for example. You can choose a boat tour and visit the Red Beach, the White Beach, and the Black Beach. We only went to the Red Beach to snap some beautiful photos. Perissa and Perivolos are the most known beaches on this island, and there are sunbeds, tavernas, and shops. If you prefer a more secluded beach, go for Vourvoulos or Koloumpo. Bring your "shoes" as most beaches are rocky. 

5.) Visit Skaros Rock 

6.) Visit the Church Three Bells of Fira 

7.) Visit the Museum of Prehistoric Thera 

8.) Visit Nea Kameni Volcanic Park 

9.) Visit the Historical Landmark of Ancient Thera 

10.) Rent a SUP 

11.) Go to Lost Atlantis Experience Museum 

12.) Go for a wine tasting at one of Santorini's Wineries 

13.) Try the Vinsanto Wine 

14.) Go to a cooking class 

15.) Eat a Santorinian Salad 

16.) Eat tomato fritters 

17.) Eat the local dish of fava 

18.) Stay in a cave hotel 

19.) Go to the Church of the Resurrection of the Lord in Imerovigli for one of the most picturesque views in Santorini 

20.) Try the local beer from the Santorini Brewing Company, the one with the Donkey. 

21.) Visit the ruins of the Castle of Oia 

22.) Eat freshly caught fish in Ammoudi Bay 

23.) Take a picture with the blue domes in Oia (Resurrection of the Lord Holy Orthodox Church) 

24.) Go on the hiking trail from Fira to Oia 

It is more than 12 kilometers long so don't forget your water. 

25.) Visit the picturesque town of Pyrgos 

26.) Visit the Tomato Industrial Museum

27.)  

With its spectacular views, famous sunsets, whitewashed villas that tumble down volcanic cliffs, and blue domed churches, Santorini is one of the most beautiful islands in the world. 

The medieval capital 
The commanding conical rock of Skaros, visible from the settlements of Fira and Imerovigli, is situated 330m above sea level. Here you will discover the medieval capital of Santorini. And within the Venetian castle, you will find houses, temples, and the former residences of the nobility. Climb to the top and the entire panorama of the caldera – from Oia to Fira – unfolds before you.
