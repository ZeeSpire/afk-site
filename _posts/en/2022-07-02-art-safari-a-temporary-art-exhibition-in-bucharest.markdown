We went to Art Safari today for the first time, although the event has reached its ninth edition this year. After today we will probably try to go to every edition. Visiting Art Safari is a good way to spend a few quality hours on the weekends.

The tickets can also be purchased online from [here](https://tickets.artsafari.ro/e?lang=en){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}. At the time of writing this article, a day access ticket costs 80 lei (16 euros), and a night tour costs 130 lei (26 euros). 

Art Safari is temporarily housed in the superb Dacia-Romania Palace on Lipscani Street, a historic space built in the late 1890s. 

We went there wanting to see Theodor Aman's artwork which did not disappoint, but we were also pleasantly surprised by Irina Dragomir's first solo exhibition. 

The exhibits are very well highlighted due to the special lighting, but the descriptions of the artworks are hardly visible in low light, this is something that can be improved. Other than that, we only have words of praise. 

Update: We also visited 10th edition. Check it out [here](/art-safari-a-temporary-art-exhibition-in-bucharest-10th-edition/).
