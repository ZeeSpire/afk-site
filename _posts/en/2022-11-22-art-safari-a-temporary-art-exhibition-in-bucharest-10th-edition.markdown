Art Safari, the famous art exhibition in the capital of Romania, has reached its tenth edition.

After visiting the ninth edition, about which you can find out more information [here](/art-safari-a-temporary-art-exhibition-in-bucharest/) we set out to reach in the next editions or at least to try.

So last weekend we went to Art Safari housed in the Dacia-România Palace in Lipscani street.

We are no experts or connoisseurs, but we liked the ninth edition more. I think that from the tenth edition, our favorite exhibition was Ștefan Popescu - Travel stories.

You can go to Art Safari 10th edition from September 23 to December 11, 2022. There are several types of tickets. Details about ticket types [here](https://tickets.artsafari.ro/e?lang=ro){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

We opted, as last time, for the ticket with one-day access to all five exhibitions. I bought the tickets on Black Friday with a 50% discount, the full price of a ticket being 120 RON (24 EUR), 50% more than the previous edition.

We look forward to the 11th edition.
