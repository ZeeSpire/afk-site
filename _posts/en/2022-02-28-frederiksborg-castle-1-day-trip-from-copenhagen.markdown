Having a 5 days vacation in Copenhagen, we set out for a one-day trip outside the city to experience more of Denmark's beauties.

We had to choose between lots of one-day trips, like visiting Kronborg Castle, the idyllic fishing village Dragør, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Dyrehaven ("the deer park"), the oldest amusement park in the world - Bakken, the Viking Ship Museum and the Cathedral in Roskilde, the birthplace of H.C. Andersen - Odense, Mons Klint, and many more. 

And we would have visited all of them if we stayed at least two weeks, but we had to choose only one. And the winner was... Frederiksborg Castle.

It's very easy to get there. From Copenhagen Central Station you take the S-train (line A) to Hillerød Station. In 45 minutes, you'll arrive. 

The train ticket is covered by Copenhagen Card. In this article, I've written more about [Copenhagen Card](/tips-for-visiting-copenhagen-for-the-first-time/).

Hillerød is approximately 35 km to the north of Copenhagen, and it is a charming little town with pedestrian streets full of shops, restaurants, and cafes.
From Hillerød Station there is a 15 to 20 minutes walk to the castle (1.5 km).

Frederiksborg Castle is situated on the Slotssøen which means Castle Lake, it was built by King Christian IV in the early decades of the 17th century and is the largest Renaissance complex in the Nordic region.

Since 1878 Frederiksborg Castle has housed The Museum of National History, which presents 500 years of Danish history with a collection of portraits, history paintings, furniture, and applied art.

An adult ticket costs 90 DKK which is approximately 12 EUR / 13.5 USD. The entry is free if you have the Copenhagen Card.

The visit wouldn't be complete without a walk through the Castle's Gardens. The gardens alone are worth a visit.

There is a symmetrically constructed Baroque Garden with perfectly straight hedges. There is also a romantic, English-style garden, where the small Bath House Castle is located. There are many small lakes and each one is unique and has its own beauty. You can also enjoy a delicious brunch at Cafe Havehuset located in the gardens. Here is their [menu]( https://cafehavehuset.dk/en/menu/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}. 

After a full, but very pleasant day, we returned to Copenhagen, and we kindly recommend to anyone who has a spare day to visit Frederiksborg Castle.
